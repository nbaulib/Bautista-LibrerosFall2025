        <h2>About Laetiporus Sulphureus</h2>

        <p>
            Laetiporus is a genus of edible mushrooms found throughout much of the world. Some species, especially
            Laetiporus sulphureus, are commonly known as sulphur shelf, chicken of the woods, the chicken mushroom, or
            the
            chicken fungus because it is often described as tasting like and having a texture similar to that of
            chicken.
        </p>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Laetiporus sp. from Anamalai Hills, Southern Western Ghats, India</p>

        <p>
            Individual "shelves" range from 5 to 25 centimetres (2 to 10 inches) across. These shelves are made up of
            many
            tiny tubular filaments (hyphae). The mushroom grows in large brackets; some have been found that weigh over
            45
            kilograms (100 pounds).
        </p>

        <p>
            Young fruiting bodies are characterized by a moist, rubbery, sulphur-yellow to orange body sometimes with
            bright
            orange tips. Older brackets become pale and brittle almost chalk-like, mildly pungent, and are often dotted
            with
            beetle or slug/woodlouse holes.
        </p>

        <p>
            The name "chicken of the woods" is not to be confused with another edible polypore, Maitake (Grifola
            frondosa)
            known as "hen of the woods/rams head‚Äù or with Lyophyllum decastes, known as the "fried chicken mushroom".
