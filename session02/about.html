        <h2>About Laetiporus Sulphureus</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Laetiporus sulphureus</b> is a species of bracket fungus (fungi that grow on trees). Its common names
            include
            <b>sulphur polypore</b>, <b>sulphur shelf</b>, and <b>chicken-of-the-woods</b>. Its fruit bodies grow as
            striking golden-yellow
            shelf-like structures on tree trunks and branches. Old fruitbodies fade to pale beige or pale grey. The
            undersurface of the fruit body is made up of tubelike pores rather than gills.
        </p>

        <p>
            Found in Europe and North America, L. sulphureus is a saprophyte and occasionally a weak parasite, causing
            brown
            cubical rot in the heartwood of trees on which it grows. Unlike many bracket fungi, it is edible when young,
            <i>although adverse reactions have been reported</i>.
        </p>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            The fruiting body emerges directly from the trunk of a tree and is initially knob-shaped, but soon expands
            to
            fan-shaped shelves, typically growing in overlapping tiers. It is sulphur-yellow to bright orange in color
            and has a suedelike texture. Old fruitbodies fade to tan or whitish. Each shelf may be anywhere from 5 to 60
            centimetres across and up to 4â€“12 cm thick. The fertile surface
            is sulphur-yellow with small pores or tubes and produces a white spore print. When fresh, the flesh is
            succulent with a strong fungal aroma and exudes a yellowish, transparent juice, but soon becomes dry and
            brittle.
