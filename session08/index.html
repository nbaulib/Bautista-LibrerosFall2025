			<h2>About</h2>

			<p>Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, commonly known as zombie-ant fungus,[2] is an insect-pathogenic fungus,
				discovered by the British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace in 1859. Zombie ants, infected by the
				Ophiocordyceps unilateralis fungus, are predominantly found in tropical rainforests.</p>

			<p>These fungi thrive in warm, humid environments, which are ideal for their growth and reproduction.
				However, they can also be found in warm-temperate forest systems. The fungus primarily targets ants from
				the tribe Camponotini, including carpenter ants (genus Camponotus).</p>

			<p>O. unilateralis infects ants of the tribe Camponotini, with the full pathogenesis being characterized by
				alteration of the behavioral patterns of the infected ant. Infected hosts leave their canopy nests and
				foraging trails for the forest floor, an area with a temperature and humidity suitable for fungal
				growth; they then use their mandibles to attach themselves to a major vein on the underside of a leaf,
				where the host remains after its eventual death.[3] The process, leading up to mortality, takes 4â€“10
				days, and includes a reproductive stage where fruiting bodies grow from the ant's head, rupturing to
				release the fungus's spores. O. unilateralis is, in turn, also susceptible to fungal infection itself,
				an occurrence that can limit its impact on ant populations, which has otherwise been known to devastate
				ant colonies.</p>

			<p>Ophiocordyceps unilateralis and related species are known to engage in an active secondary metabolism
				for, among other reasons, the production of substances active as antibacterial agents that protect the
				fungus-host ecosystem against further pathogenesis during fungal reproduction. Because of this secondary
				metabolism, an interest in the species has been taken by natural products chemists, with corresponding
				discovery of small molecule agents (e.g. of the polyketide family) of potential interest for use as
				human immunomodulatory, anti-infective, and anticancer agents.</p>
